# Image Classification CNN model prototype

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed for classifying images into predefined categories, 
focusing on transparency and interpretability. Beyond accuracy, the model ensures its decision-making process is understandable and justifiable. Using a custom-labeled dataset of over 60,000 32x32 color images across 40+ classes, the model's predictions are both accurate and explainable.
