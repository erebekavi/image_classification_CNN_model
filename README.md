# Image Classification CNN model prototype

a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images into predefined categories(web-based).
The model should be transparent (white-box), meaning that its decision-making process should be understandable and interpretable. 
This involves not just achieving high accuracy, but also ensuring that the model's predictions can be explained and justified. 
A labeled dataset of images where each image is associated with a specific category. 
For this example, we created our own  dataset, which consists of more than 60,000 32x32 color images in more than 40 classes.
